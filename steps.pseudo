1. Initialize the Quiz:
   - Start the application:
     - Set up the quiz with an array of questions, where each question has:
       - A question prompt.
       - The correct answer.
   
   - Define the quiz rules:
     - Set the time limit for answering each question (e.g., 10 seconds).
     - Set the total quiz duration (e.g., 30 seconds) for completing all questions.

2. Start the Quiz:
   - Initialize the score to zero.
   - Set the current question index to the first question.

3. Ask a Question:
   - Display the current question:
     - Show the question prompt.
     - Start a timer that:
       - Counts down the remaining time for this question (e.g., from 10 seconds).
       - Displays the remaining time every second.
   
   - Start a timer for the question:
     - Allow the user to input an answer within the given time.
   
   - Handle user input:
     - If the user answers the question within the time limit:
       - Stop the timer.
       - Check if the answer is correct:
         - If correct: Increase the score.
         - If wrong: Provide the correct answer.
     - If the user doesn't answer in time:
       - Display a message indicating that time is up.
       - Move to the next question automatically.

4. Move to the Next Question:
   - Move to the next question after the current question is answered or if time runs out:
     - Increase the question index by one.
     - If there are more questions, repeat the process and ask the next question.

5. Track Total Quiz Time:
   - Set up a total quiz timer:
     - Start a separate timer that counts down the overall quiz duration (e.g., 30 seconds).
     - If the total time runs out:
       - Stop the quiz.
       - Display the final score.

6. End the Quiz:
   - End the quiz when:
     - All questions are answered.
     - The total quiz time runs out.
   
   - Display the final score:
     - Show how many questions were answered correctly out of the total.

   - Exit the quiz gracefully.

Error Handling:
   - Handle invalid inputs:
     - If the user inputs something unexpected (e.g., an empty string), provide a message asking them to try again.
   
   - Handle timeouts:
     - If the time for a question runs out, move to the next question automatically.
   
   - Gracefully end the quiz if the total time runs out, ensuring all timers are stopped and the final score is displayed.
